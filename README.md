# hello-world

Hello world, I'm Robbie Western. I am a Physics graduate and prospective software developer and I plan to use GitHub to build up a portfolio of personal projects and improve my coding ability. As a musician, I am particularly excited to experiment with the up and coming SOUL programming language. On top of my interests in music and code, I like to spend my time writing about myself in text files.
